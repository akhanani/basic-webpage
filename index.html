    Throughout most of China's history it was ruled by powerful families
      called dynasties. The first dynasty was the Shang and the last was the
      Qing. Ancient China also boasts the longest lasting empire in history. It
       began with the Qin dynasty and the first emperor Qin who united all of
       China under one rule in 221 BC.

<h2>City Hall </h2>
<img class="rotateimg90" src="20180306_093422.jpg"src= alt="hall" width="200" height="200">

<p>The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott. Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings was imported from Europe.
Auditorium with Organ

The Organ was built by Messrs Norman and Beard of London and Norwich, the specifications were drawn up by Sir George Martin, organist of St Paul's Cathedral in London especially for the City Hall. The workmanship and materials are of high quality, and the organ made from mahogany, teak and pine. Sir George Martin spoke of it as “a magnificent instrument in every gradation of tone, from the softest stop to the most powerful tuba being found in the organ, and all under the most perfect control, and that altogether the instrument must be regarded as an artistic and mechanical triumph”. There are altogether 3165 pipes varying from 32 feet (10 metres) to 3⁄4 inch (19 millimetres). The wind was supplied by a Kinetic Blower worked by an electric motor.</p>

<h1>Castle of Good Hope</h1>

<p>
Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest existing colonial building in South Africa.[2] It replaced an older fort called the Fort de Goede Hoop which was constructed from clay and timber and built by Jan van Riebeeck upon his arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652.[4] Two redoubts, Redoubt Kyckuit (Lookout) and Redoubt Duijnhoop (Duneheap) were built at the mouth of the Salt River in 1654.[5] The purpose of the Dutch settlement in the Cape was to act as a replenishment station for ships passing the treacherous coast around the Cape on long voyages between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).[5]

During 1664, tensions between Britain and the Netherlands rose amid rumours of war. That same year, Commander Zacharias Wagenaer, successor to Jan van Riebeeck, was instructed by Commissioner Isbrand Goske to build a pentagonal fortress out of stone.</p>

<h1>District Six</h1>
<img class=rotateimg90 src="20180306_094548.jpg" alt="district" width="200" height="200" >
<p>
District Six was a multi working-class area just off the centre of Cape Town, to the south of the Castle. Today it is an almost vacant lot, shown on maps as the suburb of Zonnebloem. Before being torn apart by the apartheid regime during the sixties and seventies, District Six, was an impoverished but lively community of 55 000, predominantly coloured people. It was once known as the soul of Cape Town, this inner-city area harboured a rich cultural life in its narrow alleys and crowded tenements. After its demise, the district became mythologised, as a rich place of the South African imagination, inspiring novels, poems, jazz and the blockbuster musical, by David Kramer and Taliep Petersen, District Six. The latter being an ex resident.

It was named the sixth district of Cape Town in 1867. Originally established as a community of freed slaves, merchants, artisans, labourers and immigrants. District Six was a centre with close links to the city and the port. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, the history of removals and marginalisation hall.</p>
